# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My personalized configuration of LazyVim

It supports python LSP, it doesn't have test running inside nvim, but instead a cool little plugin that can copy test (or any function, class etc.) reference in few formats, including pytest format, so it can be easily pasted to terminal `pytest` command

To install first backup your nvim config and run: 
`git clone git@github.com:lzieniew/nvim_config.git ~/.config/nvim`
