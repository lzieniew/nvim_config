# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My personalized configuration of LazyVim

It supports python LSP, it doesn't have test running inside nvim, but instead a cool little plugin that can copy test (or any function, class etc.) reference in few formats, including pytest format, so it can be easily pasted to terminal `pytest` command

To install first backup your nvim config and run: 
`git clone git@github.com:lzieniew/nvim_config.git ~/.config/nvim`

#Config tutorial
For me it configuring default Lazyvim config wasn't trivial, so here I will put how to do things that I found hard:

## setup python environment
out of the box Lazyvim extras python works pretty well, but there are few manuals steps to do
create venv
`python -m venv .venv`
`source .venv/bin/activate`
`pip install neovim`
optional for django autocompletion
`pip install django-stubs`

## configure ruff autoformatter
create `.ruff.toml` in the base directory of a project and put config in there, for example
```
line-length = 100

[format]
quote-style = "single"
```

## disable autoformatting
put `vim.g.autoformat = true` in `lua/config/options.lua`

## disable type checks in pyright
in codebases without extensive type specifying pyright gives a lot of type errors, which are distracting
They can be disabled by changing diagnostic rules checking mode to off
Create a file .pyrightconfig.json in repository root and add 
```
{
  "typeCheckingMode": "off"
}
```
WARNING! - it doesn't work for me - to investigate
